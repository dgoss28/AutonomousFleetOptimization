    "This project will optimize the spacing of the Tesla Fleet with relation to distance from car owner and other Tesla vehicles to maximize the amount of topical city map that can be covered, minimize the distance to a customer, or maximize the amount of customers the fleet can serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "As more Tesla vehicles are introduced to city streets and autonomous driving becomes safe enough to be passed by legislature to become a normal activity, Tesla cars may be added to the Tesla Fleet. As described by Elon Musk in his second master plan, the Tesla fleet will consist of cars that will have the availability to act as a taxi or delivery service for other corporations that may want to use them. (electrek.co) This means owners of Tesla will be able receive income on their car when they are not using it. In order to maximize this profit, the cars will be optimally spaced from one another to cover more area of use. The cars also must remain within a reasonable distance of the owner so it can be “picked up” by their owner at their own discretion. The team plans to use optimization regularizations to put emphasis on these different components of this objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this formulation will be based off distances on a map. Initially, the team will analyze a simple grid to begin formulation and then larger grids that will be synthetically generated to allow for the Fleets location to change as the map size changes and the number of cars changes. The following report will have a mathematical model to outline the variables, constraints and objective functions of different models to solve the different problems. Next, a JuMP code will be written to solve the model and discuss the different components that change as it grows. Lastly, we will discuss the findings and give recommendations for how Tesla can use our model to help them formulate the placement of cars in their fleet.  \n",

    "## Mathematical Model\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "- Cars can travel in a straight line from their starting point to another location\n",
    "- The task that is performed when at the customer will not stray the vehicle to far from its owner\n",
    "- All cars are full of charge or have enough to complete tasks throughout the time in the fleet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2a. Constrain Owner Proximity (m1)\n",
    "##### Decision Variables\n",
    "- The decision variables being considered are the X and Y coordinates of a vehicle located on the city map. These will be numerical and not constrained by integer values along this grid. We will introduce a different amount of cars as the model progresses so the amount of these variables will change. The variables be denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left[\n",
    "X_n , Y_n\n",
    "\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each of these locations will have a radial area that it covers on the map. The size of the radius will be an implemented parameter within the model, $r$. In essence, the car itself is the size of its radial coverage with the center point being the cars location. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ Area = \\pi r^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Constraints\n",
    "- The cars must remain on the grid based off the given size with grid size adjsuting by parameter, $ p $. These constraints will look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 0 \\le X_n \\le p \\\\\n",
    " 0 \\le Y_n \\le p $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vehicles must be within distance of the owner, given by $v$, to allow for pickup. The owner's will be a random variable due to the fact that they may go to different locations on the grid. The coordinates of the owner will be represented by $\\left[A_n , B_n \\right]$. And the distance contraint will be represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sqrt{(X_n - A_n)^2 + (Y_n - B_n)^2} \\le v\\space for \\space  n = 1,2, \\ldots, n$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cars should not overlap their coverage circles, we will use the radius parameter, $r$, to assist in this constraint. This constraint will also not allow the cars to be in the same location as one another and will satisfy: $\\left[X_1 , Y_1 \\right] \\ne \\left[X_2 , Y_2 \\right]\\ne \\ldots \\ne \\left[X_n , Y_n \\right]$\n",
    " Also using the distance formula, the constraint for vehicles 1 and 2 not being within the radial distance of another is as follows:\n",

    "- The objective of this is to maximize the space that the fleet covers on a given map. We will use a regularization technique to allow for a tradeoff of space allowed to be covered by the vehicle and the distance that it can be placed from the driver. The maximization will allow for the cars to naturally spread along the grid to cover more area. We will make the vertices of the location of the cars to create the largest area of a polygon. The objective funciton will look as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Constraints\n",
    "- For this model, the constraints that did not allow for overlapping of coverage and the proximity to the ownner were removed. Ignoring the location of the owner is appropriate allowing the cars to go anywhere on the map.\n",

This allows quick availability for an owner that may need their car immediately. The parameter of the distance of the vehicle itself can be changed based on an owner's preference. This model has its obvious limitations in that it doesn't necessarily have an optimal position for the cars, it just ensures that they're within range."

This iteration attempts to minimize the overall distance between the vehicles and customers. This is a generalized summation, meaning that a car may sacrifice the availability to customers within its radius to be placed in an area that is more effecient for the overall customer population. This model is prone to longer optimization times based on the overall size of the customer population."

    "This model was able to show us the ways in which inner-city car sharing and travel can be revolutionized. Though the levels of complexity and sophistication will undoubtedly rise as the technology becomes available, we were still able to see the ways in which demand, ownership, and resources effect ride sharing. The complexity of this subject continues to evolve, and thus the models do. This is reflected in the increasing complexity of our iterations. The topic of autonomous ride-sharing will continue to gain momentum into the future, and our model could continue to expand to reflect the complexity of the system. For example, we could take into account realitic city street models where the vehicles are constrained to driveable areas that have traffic restrictions. Also, we could use traffic data and distance to determine the optimal locations based on time, or model tradeoffs between time and profitability. We breifly analyzed a profitability model, but one could also develop and model certain parameters like the overall environmental impact of a car while it's doing a certain task. "
